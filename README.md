# Iris-dataset-analysis---Classification
Our project employs ML to classify iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements. Algorithms like SVM, Decision Trees, KNN are explored, evaluating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Insights gained aid botany, agriculture, and environmental science in species identification and conservation.
